# CloudProjects: A Collection of Practical Go Applications

Welcome to **CloudProjects**, a repository showcasing a variety of practical applications built in Go. This collection represents a journey through building and refining tools that solve real-world problems while exploring Go's powerful frameworks and libraries. 

Each project here is designed with a focus on functionality, simplicity, and learning, catering to a diverse range of use cases—from URL shorteners to task management tools.

In this repository, you’ll find projects like a **URL Shortener with a GUI**, blending the elegance of the Gin framework with the user-friendly Fyne desktop library, and a lightweight **Mux-based URL Shortener** built for simplicity and efficiency. 

There’s also a **To-Do List Manager**, demonstrating the fundamentals of CRUD operations in Go and many more.

Many more mini-project ideas are underway so there is much more to come!
